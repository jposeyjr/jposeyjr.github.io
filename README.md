# James Posey's Online Portfolio

## Description

My online portfolio to show off my latest projects and soon to be blog posts. This is a fully static site with the ability to make dynamic blog posts with a custom none markdown generating file system. Any blog post that is added will automatically get it's own route, article card, and full size blog post. I wanted to make a personal site that didn't need a server to keep costs low and overhead minimal. At the same time I didn't want to make a full component every single time I wanted to write a blog post. This was a challenging tasks and I learned a lot coding it, I'm sure I will learn ways to improve it and perfect it in the future as I continue to learn.



## Technologies Used

React, Redux, Material-UI, React-Router, and Yarn
